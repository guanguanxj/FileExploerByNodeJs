# FileExploerByNodeJs
My first NodeJS program.

I go on the road of NodeJs...

Learning the book "SMASHING Node.js:JavaScript Everywhere".

Below is the requirement:

1.Use Node CLI and FS API
2.when the program starts, to dispaly the files list of the current directory.
3.To display the file context when you select a file or its directory info when you shelect a directory.

How  to run the program.

  0 example-1.js
  1 example-2.js
  2 index.js
  3 package.json
  4 test

Enter your choice: 2 // the index number,for example , I choose index.js which number is '2'
// the context of index.js file //
